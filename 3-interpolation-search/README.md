# 3 Interpolation Search

If you were trying to find "Anna" in a sorted List of Names. Would you start searching in the Middle of the List?

If not, where would you start searching? Do you think that we can apply this to our Binary Search to make it even more efficient?

What are the requirements for this to work?

How do you think its Best Case, Average Case and Worst Case Scenarios perform compared to Binary Search?

We don't have time to cover this topic in class, but I hope this serves as inspiration to the endless possibilities of algorithms :)
